# Wiki Tool

## A simple wiki tool built using:
- Node
- Express
- SQLite3
- React

This project is still being developed. 
You can try to run it/upgrade it locally.
The database/api and the client will each run on different local server. 
You have to install the packages seperately in each folder and then run the project:

```
# /wiki-db
npm install
npm run start

# /client
npm install
npm run start
```
